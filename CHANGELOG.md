# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Widget crash on stale/invalid view index — lookups now return Option with graceful fallback
- CEF pixel buffer integer overflow — checked arithmetic prevents buffer over-read on corrupted dimensions
- Advanced widget HiDPI scaling — scroll offset and content height now scaled correctly

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Blitz keyboard event handling — translates iced key events to blitz, enabling form interaction
- Blitz right-click, middle-click, back/forward mouse button support
- Blitz dark mode detection via `ICED_WEBVIEW_COLOR_SCHEME` env var and `GTK_THEME` fallback
- CEF mouse modifier tracking (Shift, Ctrl, Alt passed to mouse events)

### Fixed
- All engines: invalid ViewId no longer panics — `find_view` returns Option with graceful fallback
- Blitz frame comparison now uses hash instead of full pixel buffer diff
- CEF child processes (zygote, GPU, network service) left running after exit — added proper shutdown
- Litehtml selection rectangles cleared on page navigation
- Litehtml image staging deduplicates by URL (last write wins)

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- Servo engine view cutting off at ~2/3 screen height — viewport was never initialized after webview creation
- Servo engine not resizing when window size changes — direct rendering context resize was short-circuiting servo's internal viewport/reflow pipeline
- Advanced webview flickering with servo/cef — was using image Handle path instead of shader widget, causing texture cache churn during scrolling

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-22

### Changed
- Default feature switched from `blitz` to `litehtml` — blitz and servo are git-only and can't be published to crates.io
- Publish workflow uses `publish.sh` to strip git-only deps before publishing

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- CEF engine — full Chromium browser via cef-rs (Tauri) behind the `cef` feature flag

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- Minimal `webview` example (just the page, no buttons or view switching)
- Shared `resolve_url()` and `is_same_page()` utilities to reduce duplication across engines
- Servo key mappings for Insert, CapsLock, NumLock, ScrollLock, Pause, PrintScreen, ContextMenu

### Fixed
- Blitz hanging on page load — `drain_resources()` was triggering full resolve + render every 10ms tick; replaced with height-change detection, a resource tick budget, and a render height cap (8192px)

### Changed
- Updated README with rendering performance comparison, Blitz known issues, and engine docs

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Servo engine — full browser (HTML5, CSS3, JS via SpiderMonkey) as a third engine option behind the `servo` feature flag

### Changed
- Blitz deps switched from crates.io to git (DioxusLabs/blitz main) — now uses stylo 0.12, same as Servo, so both features coexist
- Updated blitz companion crates: anyrender 0.7, anyrender_vello_cpu 0.9, peniko 0.6
- Minimum Rust version bumped to 1.90

## [0.0.9] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- Blitz engine — Rust-native HTML/CSS renderer (Stylo + Taffy + Vello) with modern CSS support (flexbox, grid)

### Changed
- Default engine switched from Ultralight to Blitz
- Removed Ultralight engine and all related dependencies, build scripts, and resource handling

## [0.0.8] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- CSS `@import` resolution with recursive fetching
- CSS cache pre-loading so litehtml resolves stylesheets without network access during parsing
- Image URL resolution against stylesheet base URLs (not just page URL)

### Changed
- Stylesheet handling switched from HTML inlining to a cache-based approach via `import_css` callback
- `take_pending_images` now includes baseurl context for correct relative URL resolution
- litehtml container wrapped in `WebviewContainer` to handle CSS imports and image baseurls

## [0.0.7] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- litehtml engine with HTTP fetching, image loading, link navigation
- Example and docs for running with litehtml
